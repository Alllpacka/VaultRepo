# The decline of American Dream
The American Dream, a term crowned by [James Truslow Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Truslow_Adams), primarily focuses on individual freedom, equal chances not only in life but also in the economic world, hard work and its rewards.
That was the original idea behind it, but over the years it changed to fit the conditions of Americans at the time. In the time of the Cold War and thus the *Golden Age of the American Capitalism* the American Dream consisted of having a nice family Home in a suburb, a low-cut green garden, a dog, two kids and a well-paying job to afford anything you could want. But with the ever growing divide of the upper and lower class, the dream slowly shifted into having a stable income to cover the debts, you need to take on for either university or to cover healthcare costs, and to save up money for a private pension. These worries so many people need to deal with can be traced back to companies lowering or striking benefits for even the fully-employed people. Employees have not only received less benefits from their jobs but also less pay, driving many people below the bottom line where they are fortunate if they can cover their costs on food and shelter, but sadly most can't.

The American Dream has thus become almost unachievable for a large percentage of the population.

# The European Dream
In contrast to the American Dream the European Dream hold unity, peace, solidarity, tolerance, economic prosperity and inclusiveness as it's primary values. The dream wants to portray an environment where every human is equal and all differences are celebrated and respected, the American Dream focuses on more selfish values like, autonomy, independence and personal wealth but has some more communally oriented qualities like a strong work ethic, patriotism and religious inheritance.
The European Dream began in the 1950s with Europe-wide collaborations in economics (*[EEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community)*) and atomic power (*[EURATOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euratom)*) and grew with the integration of more states in the coming decades. Each member of the EU is supported by every other member in order to pursue the path of progress.
The European Dream has been challenged multiple times in the last two decades, with bailouts for member states in times of a global economic crisis and thousands of refugees seeking a home. The EU failed to provide one solution for these problems and thus every state has their own solution, wich vary drastically from each other. Many have lost faith in the dream but others are still holding on.
Most of the criticism of the European Dream comes from people already inside the EU, but for many people on the outside the dream is still thriving, not only because they can see the benefits of a large union but also because they are save there and won't be threatened by their own country.

# Conclusion
The American Dream is not dead, but has been twisted from what it originally portrayed to fit into the capitalistic hellscape that is today's america, with a large percentage of families unable to afford basic living conditions while a few ultra-rich people think about buying their next super-car or yacht.

Subject: Report on teenager problems

Introduction

Many teenagers these days have problems, due to time management, conflicts, expectations, and other problems. 400 European teenagers were interviewed for these results, discussed below. The aim of this report is to present the problems many teenagers are facing and suggest solutions.

Time management

Around three quarters of the interviewed teenagers answered that one of their problems is to manage their time outside of school correctly. Many teenagers may not know how to correctly split their work or school life to their personal life and thus inflate one of them to a point where the other one is almost completely neglected. A solution to this problem would be a timetable to mark out time blocks for school or work life and for personal life.

Conflict and disagreement

A bit over half of the participants mentioned conflicts and disagreement as one of their major problems. As this is mostly a personal problem means that there is no concreate solution to all problems. One recommendation is talking to family or friends about the problem.

Unrealistic expectations

Roughly 35 Percent of teenagers listed unrealistic expectations as a problem of their life. This may come from their parents comparing them to other students or their earlier accomplishments in school and basing their expectations on them. A possible solution for teenagers would be to talk to their parents about it.

Bullying and harassment

Only 28 Percent of young adults mentioned bullying and harassment on this survey. This could be a derivative of one of the other mentioned points. It is suggested that the affected teenager should use a solution to their other problem.

Conclusion

Many teenagers face problems that they do not know how to solve by themselves. I would recommend that these teenagers should start talking about their problems to friends, family or even teachers to find a solution suitable for them.
